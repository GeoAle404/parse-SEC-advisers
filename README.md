# parse-SEC-advisers
This repository contains Python code to download and parse mutual fund adviser locations from SEC filings. You may use the code to replicate our paper ([Alekseev et al., 2022](https://github.com/GeoAle404/research/raw/main/AGMSS_QuantityClimateHedge.pdf "AGMSS_QuantityClimateHedge")) or in your own projects. While the approach and methodology are all coauthors' joint work, the code is solely written by me. If you use the code, please cite the paper.
